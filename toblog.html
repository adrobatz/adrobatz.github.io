	<!--<h3>first entry</h3>
	<h4>on blogging...</h4>
	<p>I'm not a blogger. I never kept a journal growing up, and I don't typically write. <br> However, I went to the Startup Institute this past summer to try and figure out what I was going to do with my life. I went to college and studied Architecture, and on some levels, it didn't feel right, but on others there was something that clicked. In an attempt to find what interested me, I moved to Chicago and spent 8 weeks on the Product and Design track at SIC. <br> This blog has many purposes. Sometimes I'll be posting pictures that I've taken on trips, around Chicago, going home, and more. I may write some things if I learn to like it. I may also use it to practice the skills I learned while at SI. </p>-->
