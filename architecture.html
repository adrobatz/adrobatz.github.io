                        <p>Every project begins as a sketch. Time spent sketching lays the foundation for the entire project. On most projects, sketching is never truly complete as it is a key tool not only for initial planning, but also for pushing projects forward when they hit a standstill, and for quickly translating thoughts to a page.</p>

                        <p>Renderings and models are the tangible representations of the final design. They often place the project into a digital or scaled representation of its surroundings to provide context and to do environmental studies. This allows me as a designer to assess more accurately how the user and the environment will interact with the design and then make changes accordingly.</p>

                        <p>The design process is not complete without considering the proper communication of the project. When presenting the proposed design to critics, I am expected to lay all the previous pieces of the design process onto a page in a manner that will allow for someone to easily follow the design process without words. This requires an understanding of scale and hierarchy to ensure that the right amount of emphasis is on each piece. </p>

                        <p>I worked alongside the Simple.Honest.Work team to build foundation research for a Platform as a Service proposal, overseen by the founder, Scott Thomas. I spent 7 weeks alongside several other students conducting interviews, building insights, and developing an understanding of what a potential consumer would be intererested in. I used the skills I developed from my research in school, as well as what I learned from the various instructors who came in to teach my track about the UX/UI design process. </p>

During this project we redesigned the Claws Mail interface. I participated on the UI side by aggregating all the information across the site and rebuilding the interface. I also assisted in building some of the HTML for the <a href="images/SIC/claws.png">new site we created</a>, as well as building a proposal for a new email toolbar and creating all of the icons myself in Illustrator.</p>

                        <p>As part of the curriculum for the Web Development track, they built a Ruby on Rails Open Table clone.
