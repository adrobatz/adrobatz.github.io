			About Me
		</h2>
		<p>
			I was born and raised in Philadelphia, and I continued to stay there and attend the University of Pennsylvania where I received a degree in Architecture. I moved to Chicago, to try out a new city, and  am now a student at the Startup Institute on the Product and Design track. Outside of working and learning, I love dogs, reading, Instagram, Pinterest, and traveling and can't wait for my next trip (Disney World!) coming up in September.
